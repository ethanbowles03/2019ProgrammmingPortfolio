### -SpaceShipGame-
#### --Completed Jan. 10--
My space ship game is an object oriented program that use a ship, rocks and lasers to compose a game

You fly a f-13 through space and try to hit every astriod, as they pass, with lasers

If they pass or hit you take damage. If you health reaches 0 you lose
