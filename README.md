# First Semester
In the first semester we focused on getting learing the basics of programming by using a program called processing
## Processing
### -screenSaverApp-

My screen saver app creates a full screen screen saver that generates random lines that connect.

It has a white background and randomly generates lines that connect in shades of grey and black
